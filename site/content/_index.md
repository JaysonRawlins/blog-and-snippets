blurb:
    heading: Whats so fun about Cloud Engineering?
    text: "Cloud Engineering is about designing, building, and managing applications and services that run on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud. It involves a mix of software development, system administration, and DevOps practices to create scalable, reliable, and efficient cloud-based solutions. The fun comes from the challenge of solving complex problems, optimizing performance, and leveraging the latest technologies to build innovative applications that can adapt to changing needs."
intro:
    heading: "About me"
    text: "I'm a principal Cloud Engineer that has been working in software development and cloud computing for almost 10 years.  Due to the vast nature of this field, I've never felt like I've arrived at some type of senior level \"nirvana\".  In part, I forget things almost as quickly as I learn them, but also the field is always changing.  This means that when I was super efficient with Terraform, when started using CDK exclusively, my Terraform skills started to fade away.  Sometimes I will work on projects just to review what I used to know well.  Other times its learning new things that I haven't used before."

    heading: Current Projects
    text: "I'm currently working on a CLI Tool that helps resolve drift issues in CDK/CloudFormation stacks.  I'm also working on a project that will essentially combine the pomodoro technique with the Eisenhower Matrix to help prioritize work with some added bonus features like logging Jira Time.  The goal is to use Tauri to create a cross platform application that can be used on both Windows, Linux and if I'm successful with the authentication will work on Android and iOS."
